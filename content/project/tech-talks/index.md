Tech Talks was curated and launched by Sebastien Marion and Jim Martinez on Thursday, February 6, 2014. It was a one day event celebrating learning and technology at New York Institute of Technology (NYIT).

Inspired by PechKucha and Ignite, TechTalks adopted a format of fast-paced presentations where presenters shared their use of technology. The rules were very simple: 20 slides x 15 seconds per slide = 5 minutes of sharing. Presenters included faculty and staff from education, engineering and computer science, career services and libraries.
