Library 2050 is a project that re-imagines the University Library with the goal of starting a conversation. What we are seeing throughout higher education is a re-focusing of the library as a learning space, as opposed to a storage space - what [Roberto Greco](https://robertogreco.tumblr.com) has called the **Read/Write Library**. With a focus on learning pathways, the higher education library of the future:

* Provides users with access to `21st century technologies` in flexible and adaptive environments,
* Facilitates `transdisciplinary relationships` in the support of innovation and knowledge production, and 
* Functions as a platform for `creativity and scholarship`.

The higher education library of the future *values*:

* Scholarship & Lifelong Learning,
* Emergent Technology,
* Transdisciplinary Environments,
* Relationships & Community,
* Innovation & Experimentation, and
* Creativity & Inspiration.
