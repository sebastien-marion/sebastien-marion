How do we best support knowledge sharing and team collaboration? How do we create organizations capable of learning and improving performance?

 [Communities of Practice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SKxtIb468B_ZVnZWmt9xy01LBXiZkBmHooUoCmnmR2k/edit?usp=sharing) (COP) are groups of people who share a concern or passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly.

`Community management` and `technology stewardship` make networked learning in higher education possible. They encourage sharing of knowledge outside of traditional boundaries and allow beginners or people with weaker ties to gain access to resources for understanding through [peripheral participation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimate_peripheral_participation).
