Inspired by Edward Tanguayâ€™s [learn tracker](http://tanguay.info/learntracker/page/home), this is a place to record the notes of everything that I am learning from MOOC classes, to foreign languages, to useful code examples and technical how-to notes, so that I not only have an overview of what I have learned, but can search and recall these notes at any time.
