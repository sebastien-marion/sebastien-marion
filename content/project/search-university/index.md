Search University is a project about search, search skills, teaching search, learning how to search, learning how to use Google effectively, and learning how to do research, from pre-university to working professionals, and everything in between.

It's based on a monthly [newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/searchuniversity) that gives you brief recommendations on the best search strategies, a search tools [database](https://tools.sebastienmarion.com) and resources for learners. 

My goal is to turn this newsletter into something more substantial like a book teaching students learn how to take control of their own research and lifetime learning.
