The Learning Glass technology is deceptively simple: LED lighting on low-iron glass creates a transparent white board. With a neon marker in hand, the presenter faces the audience while [writing on the Learning Glass board](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCalRcNZ0C0lE1TMmqlyO-fw/videos). This approach improves audience engagement in both live and online presentations.
