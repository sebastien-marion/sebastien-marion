Who am I? What am I doing? I am a higher education librarian specializing in libraries, knowledge management and contemporary literacies. I am an independent thinker, online educator and expert learner.

In addition to teaching research and information literacy methods, I serve on numerous strategic committees, and am a leader in planning initiatives designed to guide the university library of the future.
