title: Collection of Teaching Places to a Community of Learning Spaces
abstract: The library is the center of higher educationâ€™s transformation from a
  collection of teaching places to a community of learning spaces. Students
  should be makers most of the day, not just consumers. This presentation is
  about reframing the cultural expectations of the library as a place.
