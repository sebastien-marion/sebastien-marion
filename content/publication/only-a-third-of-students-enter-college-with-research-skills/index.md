abstract: Research is an integral part of the college experience. Regardless of
  major, students are required to discover information and then interpret and
  synthesize their findings either orally or in writing. A recent Library
  Journal survey reveals that only 30% of first-year students enter college
  prepared with college-level research skills. In this interview with GoodCallâ€™s
  Terri Williams, I offer advice to students who are transitioning from high
  school to college.
