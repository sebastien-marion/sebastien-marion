abstract: MOOCs, or Massive Open Online Courses, place all materials and
  practices used in a traditional college class (including video lectures,
  reading assignments, tests, writing assignments, and interaction between
  students) online. What distinguishes a MOOC from more traditional online
  courses is that a MOOC is open to anyone who wants to enroll and, in most
  instances, is offered free. This is a short report from the New York Institute
  of Technology (NYIT) MOOC Committee.
